## Implementation

AngularJS with Angular Seed for the seperate frontend, running on Node.js with Protractor for e2e tests and Karma for unit tests. Ruby on Rails API backend communicating via JSON and http requests.

The next feature to implement would be to create a Users model, with authentication via JSON Web Tokens and Devise for users to sign up, in and out.
